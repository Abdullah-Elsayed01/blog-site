## A multi page project that illustrates blogs and other information about John Doe
I made this project to go throw all my react skills and put it on one app and even  learn some like routing and implementing it to the project,.  

I will break the project steps to make it easier to track.

## Tools

* Tailwind
* Normalize
* Router

## Steps
- [x] Building the base structure for the project 
- [x] Put the design to the app
- [ ] Optimize the styling format and add the responsivity for each screen size (current)
- [ ] Adding the functionality 
- [ ] Routing

## Problems
currently i'm suffering from working with tailwind especially that they had a big update that changed a lot also i hadn't work on it enough so i'm getting used to it

## Installation
1. Fork the project and clone it to your  local repo then make your  
1. Make your own branch `git checkout -b add-new-compoenent`
1. Save and pull request

You can work on the project on your own i'm just trying to practice somethings.
